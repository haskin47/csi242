Self Directed Learning: I have been looking at several online tutorials for using Github, watching how others use the program to help me get more accustomed to it.
Project: I have dusted off my old website project from a few semesters ago. It is still fully functional, and ready to be put onto github, which will be my main task for this coming week.
Extra Credit: I attempted to set up a meeting with you Mr. Gray, but failed to do so. I hope to meet with you tomorrow at a new time.
