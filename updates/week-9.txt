Passcodes: WAVE and CRASH
Participation: Attended both lectures via Zoom. Asked questions.
Self-Directed Learning: MUltiple websites and tutorials looked up to find solutions to bugs in Project 3's code.
Project Game: Complete. But because of my extension, I cannot turn it in like before. I can put the links here, though. So unless told otherwise, I will do that.
As mentioned in my email, I was given an extension due to my own illness, which I am grateful for. I wasn't able to get the level of polish I wanted due to other close family members falling ill with Covid.
